Building scalable cloud infrastructure and researching energy-efficient blockchain systems. Former Infrastructure/Data Engineer Intern @ State Farm.

## 💼 Experience

**Infrastructure/Data Engineer Intern @ State Farm** (2023-2025)
- Built AWS Glue ETL pipelines reducing policy validation time by 70%
- Architected Lambda-based API service cutting deployment times by 50%
- Implemented Terraform IaC and CI/CD pipelines reducing deployments by 40%
- Analyzed millions of AWS records for infrastructure optimization

## 🔬 Research

**[Hardware Optimizations for Energy Efficiency of Cryptocurrencies](https://github.com/Kavish-Muthum/Blockchain-Consensus-Benchmarking-on-Low-Cost-AWS-EC2)** (2025)

Benchmarked PoW, PoS, BFT, and ZK consensus algorithms across ARM, x86, GPU, and FPGA architectures. Found GPU acceleration achieves 94-99% energy savings for parallelizable workloads, ARM CPUs use 23-35% less energy than x86, and FPGAs offer 74% additional savings for ZK proofs.

## 🛠️ Skills

**Cloud & Infrastructure:** AWS (Glue, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, Athena), Terraform, CI/CD

**Languages:** Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, MATLAB

**Certifications:** AWS Solutions Architect Associate, Terraform Associate, AWS Cloud Practitioner
